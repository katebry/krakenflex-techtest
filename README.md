# Kraken Flex tech test
My Kraken Flex tech test response 💪🏻🐙

## Setup

First, please clone the repo onto your local machine. 

You can do this by clicking the green `Code` button on Github and selecting one of the options from the drop down. 

Once you have the repo open locally, run the command `npm i` from your terminal.

Still in your Terminal, run the following command for each environment variable (using the ones provided in the email).

Pressing enter after each one:

```
export API_KEY=<your_value>
export URL=<URL value goes here>
export SITE_ID=<Site id value goes here>
```

## Running the project

Once you have added your environment variables, to run the project you need to open a Terminal and enter the command `npm run serve` - you should see a logged response appear

The logic that produces this logged response can be found in the `handler.ts` file

To run the tests, run the command `npm run test`

## Tasks

1. Retrieve all outages from the `GET /outages` endpoint ✅
2. Retrieve information from the `GET /site-info/{siteId}` endpoint for a certain site ✅
3. Filter out any outages that began before `2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`, or that don't have an ID that is in the list of devices in the Site Information ✅ 
4. For the remaining filtered outages, the display name of the device in the site information should be attached to each appropriate outage ✅
5. Send this compiled list of outages to the `POST /site-outages/{siteId}` endpoint
